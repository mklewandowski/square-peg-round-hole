# Square Peg, Round Hole
Ages and ages ago, a friend of mine did a series of paintings of fictional 1980s arcade machines. His paintings were little more than a name and a picture of an arcade cabinet, but they were unique and odd and packed full of nostalgia. I decided to bring a few of the paintings to life by jamming out little games based on his concepts. Square Peg, Round Hole was the second game that I did in this series. I imagined it as a quick-twitch shape matching game. I originally built Square Peg, Round Hole over the course of a weekend at the end of March, 2014 using Unity 5. As a development exercise, I decided to recreate Square Peg, Round Hole using a modern version of Unity.

## Gameplay
Square Peg, Round Hole is a simple shape matching micro-game. Switch between a square, circle, or triangle to match the theme of the scrolling shape fields that move increasingly faster and faster as the game progresses.
